			<p>Atelier Ciseaux is a french non-profit label founded in 2008 between the south-east-central mountains (le Vercors) and the north streets of Paris. Nowadays the label is spread out between Lyon, Montreal (CA) and -still- Paris. Or everywhere our laptops and minds are.</p>
			<p>More inspired by the DIY scene than by independent logos, we never wanted to impose severe guiding principles on ourselves. Our one and only ambition was always to release records we like and support bands/ artists we love. Nothing will ever be more important. Thank you.</p>
			<h3>Contact & press inquiries</h3>
			<p>For anything you want to know/say/ask, feel free to write us at <a href="mailto:atelierciseaux@gmail.com">atelierciseaux[at]gmail.com</a></p>
			<p>We speak french, english and a little bit of spanish !</p>
			<h3>Demos</h3>
			<p>Yes, of course we accept -unsolicited- demos. We are glad to listen to new music BUT like you - we hope - we are humans, not robots. It's always nicer to receive an email that starts by "Hello".</p>
			<h3>Wholesale</h3>
			<p>Our releases are available in several distro and record stores worldwide. For wholesale, please write us. We are always excited to work with new folks. Don't forget to support your local shop !</p>
			<h3>Your order</h3>

			<h3>Give us news</h3>
			<p>In 2012, we asked to the folks who bought the Mount Eerie’s 7" to send us <a href="http://amour-discipline.org/zine/mount-eerie-mosaic/" target="_blank">pic of the record</a>.</p>
